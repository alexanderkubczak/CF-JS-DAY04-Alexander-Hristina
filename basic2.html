// 	Create a function that accepts two parameters. 1st parameter is a string and the 2nd is a number of characters that should be shortened by cutting off the string from left to right.

// e.g. If we pass the following arguments in the function 1st argument = "I am a hero from World of Warcraft" and 2nd argument = "12", we should get the string "I am a hero"

	var sliced = string.slice(0, numChar);
